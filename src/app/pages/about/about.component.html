            <p>
                I was born and raised in Dallas, TX, and I currently work
                as an AI Data Trainer for Data Annotation Tech.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have over 
                <span class="text-blue-500">8 years</span>
                of programming experience and over 
                <span class="text-blue-500">1 year</span>
                of professional experience in the tech field,
                with knowledge of single-page web applications,
                RESTful APIs, and modern JS frameworks, such as
                Angular and React.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me playing the Nintendo Switch with friends,
                or singing and dancing my heart out at a music festival.
            </p>
            <p>(P.s. I'm a huuuuge Bad Bunny fan!)</p>
